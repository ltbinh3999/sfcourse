# What is this?
This is the source code for sfcourse - a simple website where you can find more information about Stanford University Computer Science course and find courses that suit your specific needs through the filters system.
# Why choose Stanford courses?
A majority of CS course in Stanford is publicly accessible with top-notch quality slides, homework and reading references. Beware that some of them are harder than your usual MOOCs.
# My tips to learn effectively:
- Read course materials carefully and rigorously. Highlighter and note are your best friends.
- Reading slides alone is usually not enough. 
- Try to do the homework by yourself. Most of the homework will have sanity tests to partly check your solution.
- Check other solution with others by searching for "github <course code> stanford"
- Find a pal or two to learn toghether.
